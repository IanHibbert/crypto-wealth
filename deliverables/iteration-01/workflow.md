# CryptoWealth

---------------

## Process

Our development process can be described as a loose version of Scrum. We will adhere to practices outlined by Scrum, but are changing certain facets to better fit a remote team. The length of each sprint will be two weeks long due to the timing of team deliverables in the course fitting multiples of two weeks.

#### Roles and Responsibilities

###### Main Roles

*Main roles are meant to give a clear and defined role to every member in the team. They are not the only roles that one would have.*

| Role | Responsibility | Member |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Front-end Master | Primarily works with the front-end (design, scripting) and is responsible for maintaining development branches associated with the front-end, including creating the sprint backlog and merging related PRs | Ian |
| Back-end Master | Primarily works with the back-end (user profiling, routing, security, database management, middleware...) and is responsible for maintaining development branches associated with the back-end, including creating the sprint backlog and merging PRs | Sakshaat |
| Chief Data Analyst | Primarily works with the data analysis (parameterization, historical analysis, suggestion algorithms) and is responsible for maintaining development branches associated with the data analysis section, including creating the sprint backlog and merging PRs | Aaron |
| Technical Lead | Works with the entire stack, merging any outstanding PRs, helping to create high-level algorithms and keeping code standards and RESTful endpoints consistent | Akshay |
| Business/QA Lead | Helps to coordinate the team for sync meetings, ensures presentation quality of the product and of deliverables, and helps to create high-level algorithms through researching resources and APIs | Harold |

###### Secondary Roles

*Secondary roles are not completely rigid as we allow any member to contribute to any part of the project.*

| Role | Responsibilities | Members |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Front-end Developer | Contribute to the front-end development, creating PRs for the Front-end Master | Sakshaat, Harold |
| Back-end Developer | Contribute to the back-end development, creating PRs for the Back-end Master | Ian, Aaron, Harold |
| Data Analyst | Contribute to the data analysis section, creating PRs for the Chief Data Analyst | Sakshaat, Harold |
| QA Engineer | Document code and test major features in preparation for sprint demonstrations | Everyone |

###### Other Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Members |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organizer (Scrum Master) | Schedule weekly meetings, conduct retrospective meetings at the end of sprints and improve the workflow and role management of the project throughout each weekly sync meeting | Akshay |
| Product Owner | Maintain a consistent vision, create high-level sketches, survey potential users to get a better sense of their problem and create the product backlog | Aaron, Harold |
| Designer | Create user-facing application sketches and decide on a general look and feel | Sakshaat, Ian |
| General Member | Work on creating deliverable documents, attend all review and planning meetings, and check Slack on a constant basis | Everyone |


#### Events

Development will mostly be happening remotely, as many of the team members are either working full-time or are unable to coordinate schedules to meet in-person for development purposes. Due to this, the team will continue to meet online over Discord as well as every Monday night in-person for weekly planning and review meetings, as well as ad-hoc standup meetings in which we will conduct weekly sync sessions. There will be a minimum of one meeting per week.

We will also consider scheduling ad-hoc code review sessions on weekends in which only certain group members would be required to attend.

Review meetings and retrospective meetings will be merged. During review meetings, we will review current progress, make any changes to our current development process if necessary and plan the next steps (whether this entails planning the next sprint, or the next development steps).

#### Artifacts

We plan to create documents which will be pushed to the GitHub repository, including product backlogs and sprint backlogs. In addition, we will use **[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/)**, a browser extension that changes GitHub issues into task board formats, and we will use these as our task board artifacts. We would also keep track of what tasks need to be done by scheduling them as "To-do" issues on GitHub, and we will create to-do lists from these to serve as artifacts.

A sample ZenHub board can be seen below:

Tasks will be assigned to teammates on GitHub through the web interface. This would be done depending on what the project requires at any given time. As each team member as a clear, defined main role, issues would first be assigned to the one(s) in charge of the respective part of the project. Then, the issue can be delegated to any relevant team members (i.e. those who are developers as a secondary role) for greater efficiency if necessary.

We can also prioritize tasks by labelling them as "High-priority". This would be done whenever an issue blocks some other part of the project from being developed, and/or when an issue impedes the progress of the sprint. The development team is expected to solve these issues first before any others. If there are multiple issues that are high-priority, the development team will work on them in a logical order that reflects the overall significance of the issue to the project.

Finally, we will also create data visualization artifacts such as burndown graphs by making use of ZenHub's analysis tools. We will be analysing these in our sprint retrospective meetings in order to comment on our development process.

A sample data visualization artifact can be seen below. This is an interactive burndown graph.
