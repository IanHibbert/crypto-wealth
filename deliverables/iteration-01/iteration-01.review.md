## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

> When: Thursday, February 9, 2017, 9pm
 
> Where: Online: Slack, Google Docs, GitHub, Discord, E-mail

## Process - Reflection

Although our team found it very difficult to agree on various meeting times, we are able to conduct productive online meetings and complete tasks by internal deadlines. So far, we have put our Monday evening tutorial time to good use as a weekly sync meeting involving discussions and quick task delegation. Our online meetings have thus far been mostly productive. We have reviewed each other’s work and have collaboratively written sections of upcoming deliverables.

#### Decisions that turned out well


1. We were able to decide and execute an efficient workflow and communication channel quite early into our project. We split up tasks in person and set an internal deadline of four days. Right after this deadline, we had an online meeting on Discord where we reviewed each other’s work afterwards. Then, we had our review meeting right afterwards over Google Docs. Using collaborative tools, we were able to come up with effective delegation of roles and effective planning, allowing us to move forward with our project efficiently.

2. We set up multiple channels in our Slack group chat that had specific purposes. For example, we made a resources channel that was made specifically for reference links and contact information. We were able to quickly refer to this channel whenever needed so that we would never lose any links, whether we were in different locations or on different devices. This allowed us to quickly refer to it when needed (e.g. in online meetings), improving our meeting efficiency.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


1. Our first iteration was slightly rushed as we took a long time (an entire week) solidifying our product idea. The gap between the planning and review meetings was only three days. This happened as not everyone attended our first planned meeting. Due to this, we were not able to establish and finish clear goals related to the product. We hope to establish a clear structure and pattern of planning and review meetings in the future, using what we have learned from this first iteration.

2. We learned that not everything is suitable to be completed on Google Docs.  Google Docs isn’t the most efficient platform when each member of the group is working on individual sections of a shared document (such as a Markdown document that is better suited for GitHub).

3. Discord’s sound quality turned out to be poor after having our first extended live chat meeting. There were intermittent breaks in reception. We will try Skype next time.


#### Planned changes


We plan to use a group collaborative calendar as a meeting scheduler that the whole team constantly has access to. We will create Google Calendar events that provide us with email notifications (which we all check daily, anyways), so that our team doesn’t have to check another separate resource to get information, which would decrease our efficiency.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


Delegated meaningful roles for each member of the team so everybody has a clear idea of what they are responsible for.

Clearly defined the direction of the product by creating [user personas](https://app.xtensio.com/folio/i9ssxw11).

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:


1. We did not start to come up with any data analysis algorithms for the main core of our project. We still have a long way to go in terms of research (into the existing space for robo-advisors’ algorithms and into cryptocurrency markets) to start on this, so we will leave it for a future iteration.

2.   We did not decide on a tech stack to use. We felt that it was too early to commit to languages or frameworks that members were either not familiar with or could possibly be substituted by something more appropriate, given that we had not started coding quite yet.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. We have to decide on a tech stack to use for the web application that everyone in the group is comfortable with (or is willing to learn) and is suitable for what we plan to achieve with the project.

2. We must decide on a basic high-level project design structure as a starting point for us to start coding.  We will have our project architecture mapped out by the next iteration.  This includes storyboarding the website interface and walking through sample user experiences. We will likely look at other tools in the space (e.g. WealthSimple) as reference material.

3. We should start working on the data analysis algorithm required to come up with profitable portfolios for potential client. This would be the core of our project so it is better if we start working on this as soon as possible. We expect this part of our project to go through many iterations and will be updated constantly up until the project deadline.
