## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

> When: Thursday, February 9, 2017, 9pm
 
> Where: Online: Slack, Google Docs, GitHub, Discord, E-mail

## Process - Reflection

Although our team found it very difficult to agree on various meeting times, we are able to conduct productive online meetings and complete tasks by internal deadlines. So far, we have put our Monday evening tutorial time to good use as a weekly sync meeting involving discussions and quick task delegation. Our online meetings have thus far been very productive. We have reviewed each other’s work and have collaboratively written sections of upcoming deliverables.

#### Decisions that turned out well


We were able to decide and execute an efficient workflow and communication channel quite early into our project. We splitting up tasks in person and set an internal deadline of four days. Right after this deadline, we had an online meeting on Discord where we reviewed each other’s work afterwards. Then, we had our review meeting right afterwards over Google Docs. Using collaborative tools, we were able to come up with effective delegation of roles and effective planning, allowing us to move forward with our project efficiently.

2. We were able to decide together on a meaningful product idea that we were all comfortable with doing. We chatted with the TA’s and the professor in order to solidify our angle and approach towards defining our user base and solving their problem. While this made our first iteration slightly rushed (making it only four days), we hope to use this decision to go forward with a clear vision for our project.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


During our first planned meeting, only a couple of our team members were able to meet. (Due to different schedules, last minute engagements, etc.) While this initial meeting did get us started, we hope to plan meetings well in advance for next time so that meetings could be more productive in the future.

We learned that not everything is suitable to be completed on Google Docs.  Google Docs isn’t the most efficient platform when each member of the group is working on individual sections of a shared document (better suited for GitHub).
Discord’s sound quality turned out to be poor after having our first extended live chat meeting. There were intermittent breaks in reception. We will try Skype next time.


#### Planned changes


We plan to use a group collaborative calendar as a meeting scheduler that the whole team constantly has access to. We will create Google Calendar events that provide us with email notifications (which we all check daily, anyways), so that our team doesn’t have to check another separate resource to get information, which would decrease our efficiency.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


Completed necessary parts of the deliverable documentation (product.md, iteration-01.plan.md).
Delegated meaningful roles for each member of the team so everybody has a clear idea of what they are responsible for.
Clearly defined the direction of the product by creating potential user personas.
Reached a decision on which project management tools would work best for the team given our project structure and deadline.
Established a clear meeting schedule for the team to be updated frequently on our team Google Calendar.

	6.  Rough sketch - a high level overview of the data flow for our product. This sketch will allow us to determine the core features we need to implement.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:


We did not start to come up with any data analysis algorithms for the main core of our project. We still have a long way to go in terms of research (into the existing space for robo-advisors’ algorithms and into cryptocurrency markets) to start on this, so we will leave it for a future iteration.

2.   We did not decide on a tech stack to use. We felt that it was too early to commit to languages or frameworks that members were either not familiar with or could possibly be substituted by something more appropriate, given that we had not started coding quite yet.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

We have to decide on a tech stack to use for the web application that everyone in the group is comfortable with (or is willing to learn) and is suitable for what we plan to achieve with the project.

Decide on a basic high-level project design structure as a starting point for us to start coding.  We will have our project architecture mapped out by the next iteration.  This includes storyboarding the website interface and walking through sample user experiences. We will likely look at other tools in the space (e.g. WealthSimple) as reference material.

Add the resulting tasks and issues onto our job board on Github (ZenHub).

Start working on the data analysis algorithm required to come up with profitable portfolios for potential client. This would be the core of our project so it is better if we start working on this as soon as possible. We expect this part of our project to go through many iterations and will be updated constantly up until the project deadline.
