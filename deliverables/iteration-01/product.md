### What are you planning to build?

>"Automated advisory and investing service for trading crypto-currencies.” 

  By tracking currency trends and using predictive analytics, our __website platform__ will enable users to make intelligent decisions while navigating this new and exciting market.  Unique crypto-currency portfolios will be constructed for each investor based on the level of risk they are willing to accept, their personal interests/preferences and a variety of other parameters.  Each portfolio will contain a set of crypto-currencies of differing weights.  A user's portfolio (or portfolios) will be continuously reevaluated and adjusted in order to react to market fluctuations.  Our data analytics backend will be driven by algorithms that condense information from a variety of public sources around the web and output actionable buy/sell events.  We will analyze historical trading data (using sources such as [BTER](https://bter.com/), [Crypto-Currency Market Capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and [TradeBlock](https://tradeblock.com/)), obtain data from the crypto-currency community by parsing articles on blogs and twitter, and consider input from a variety of other sources.  Our platform can be thought of as a combination between traditional robo-advisors (WealthSimple, Betterment, etc..) and crypto-currencies (BitCoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin, etc..).  Our aim is to provide a clear path to new investors wishing to enter the crypto-currency marketplace.
   

### Who are your target users?

Our target users can range from vulnerable security-conscious individuals lacking trust in mainstream centralized establishments to simply those who are interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, which are themselves novel investment vehicles.

Specifically, our users can include those who:
- are politically, socially, and economically vulnerable, such as activists, journalists, protesters, and rebels;
- are digital security-conscious;
- believe in or require anonymity;
- lack trust in centralized systems and institutions, such as the government and banks;
- are anti-authoritarian/establishment;
- are financially unreliable or “risky” investors, according to traditional metrics (e.g. credit history, income)
- engage in questionable or illicit activities;
- are tech savvy and are interested in a technologically sound, new type of investment;
- are looking to diversify their investment portfolio(s);
- are simply interested in cryptocurrencies, or not interested in mainstream equity and debt securities, and lack the time and/or knowledge to invest independently;

[Some sample user personas can be found in this link.](https://app.xtensio.com/folio/i9ssxw11)

1. Bruce is likely to be interested in decentralized crypto-currencies as he lacks trust in centralized institutions taking care of his money. Furthermore, he lacks the time and knowledge to navigate the current financial space, though he is interested in growing his money. Our application would be perfect for someone like Bruce, as it provides an quick and easy way for him to enter the crypto-currency market and have his money in decentralized accounts.

2. Chris wishes to become financially independent, but has just started to explore the professional space. As he is tech savvy, he could be interested in our application, and find that it could help him diversify his investment portfolio and help him get started in growing his money while he is still young. He could feel that our solution will help him succeed professionally while allowing him to spend his time learning new things and performing well at his current job. 

### Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

  The crypto-currency trading market is rapidly growing and evolving which presents a large number of arbitrage opportunities. The crypto-currency industry is still within its infancy and only a small set of investors are turning a profit by trading crypto-currencies. While there are currently a large number of crypto-currency platforms available for traders to execute their algorithmic trading strategies, they require in-depth knowledge of the market to be used reliably, making it very difficult for newcomers to profit.
  
  Our team is striving to open the market up to a larger set of investors who want to enter the market but are overwhelmed by the complexities of the current market environment. Newcomers will no longer need to spend days or weeks researching and learning about the intricacies of the crypto-currency market and its historical events, nor will they need to learn about the differences in the hundreds of crypto-currencies currently available today (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, ...). Those not already experienced in this market will be saved the time needed for researching it.
  
  In addition, with today’s markets becoming increasingly interdependent, many investors are wary that events out of their control (Brexit, Greece default, etc..) can have severe negative impacts on their investments.  That is part of the reason why decentralized currencies seem more attractive than traditional markets.  Crypto-currencies do not experience market fluctuations caused by government actions in the same way that established exchanges do.  An investor concerned about these potential risks would likely see our application as a suitable alternative.
  
  Currently, traders are continuously scouring the internet in search of blog reviews and possibly cross-referencing that data with historical trends in an attempt to find arbitrage opportunities.  Users that are currently playing the market (and having success doing so) are unlikely to switch over completely to our platform.  Instead, we are only looking to open the market up to new traders who are not currently using any software to fulfill their needs.

### Highlights

- We were considering applications that directly solved a major problem for a niche group of people. However, we did not personally connect with these ideas, and it was difficult to get the entire group to agree on one idea. Instead, we found that some of us were interested in crypto-currency trading already, and we decided to turn the question of "who would use this product?" on its head by including us in the target group. We were able to come to a consensus very easily once we planned out the intricacies and challenges associated with our current project plan. Some ideas we initially had include:
    - A mobile application that helps blind people detect what was in front of themselves
    - An augmented reality that corrected colours so that colour-blind people could see clearly

- Our group was also excited by the prospect of creating a product that did not have any exact parallels available in the market. As we researched the tools currently available in the crypto-currency space, we found tools that only fit in one of two categories: market analysis tools and coin exchanges. Our idea was novel, yet usable by an increasing number of people who fit into our user categories.

- We also wanted to produce a product that was a suitable challenge, and combined all the aspects of software development that we were knowledgeable about, in addition to many concepts that we have yet to learn about. As we got together to consider the scope of our project, what kinds of features our product would have and what challenges they posed, we became more motivated and willing to take on a project of such a large scope.

- Approaching our product from the perspective of a user was really helpful and enlightening, such that it forced a change in perspective and encouraged questions that we otherwise might not have asked. As our group members were included in the target market, we were able to answer these easily. We answered questions such as:
    - How do we make this simpler than existing products/services for the user?
    - Why would a user use this?
    - How do we differentiate ourselves (in terms of features, UI) from similar products for traditional equity and debt securities investing?
