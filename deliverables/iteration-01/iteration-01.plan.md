## Iteration 01 - Plan

>Start date (Planning): Monday, February 6 2017

>End date (Review): Thursday, February 9 2017

## Process

We will take a tribal approach to this iteration before we start any real development. Communication will primarily happen online as we collaborate using online tools such as Google Docs to define our product and create our artifacts for this iteration. As our team size is relatively small at five members, this approach will work for now.

#### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities | Members |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organizer | Schedule weekly meetings, conduct retrospective meetings at the end of sprints and improve the workflow and role management of the project throughout | Akshay |
| Product Owner | Create high-level sketches, survey potential users to get a better sense of their problem and create the user personas | Aaron, Harold |
| Designer | Create user-facing application sketches, research potential libraries/frameworks and decide on a general look and feel | Sakshaat, Ian |
| General Member | Work on creating deliverable documents, attend all review and planning meetings, and check Slack on a constant basis | Everyone |

#### Events

Work will mostly be happening remotely, as many of the team members are either working full-time or are unable to coordinate schedules to meet in-person for development purposes. Due to this, the team will continue to meet online over Discord as well as every Monday night in-person for weekly sync meetings. There will be a minimum of one meeting per week, and these meetings will be used to work on high-level ideas, discuss key team and workflow details and give general updates on progress.

As this iteration does not involve code, we will not be having any code review sessions this iteration.

We will have a review/retrospective meeting at the end of our iteration. We will evaluate all work we did up to that point, and come up with goals for the next iteration. We will also make any changes to our current development process (such as the adoption of a standardized workflow).

#### Artifacts

We plan to create documents which will be pushed to the GitHub repository, including a workflow document and deliverables.

 * A markdown document detailing our workflow and roles.
 * Screenshots and graphs detailing possible workflow states. This will enable us to easily decide on our choice of workflow.
 * GitHub pull requests and graphs detailing each group member's work over time.

As there are not a large number of tasks in this iteration, we will keep track via an ad-hoc tribal approach. We will go through our goals and tasks, one by one, manually, delegating them to team members as evenly as possible (so that everyone gets to contribute) and as team members express interest.

Tasks will be prioritized as to what would require attention first, i.e. what is more immediate and requires attention before the next iteration. We choose to emphasize core features of our project and a general project structure before moving on with the rest of the project.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

1. Define core features for our product. This should essentially be what a Minimum Viable Prototype would have. We will likely draw out our application's basic flow with a sketch and decide our key user stories and/or core features from there.

2. Create clear and meaningful roles for each member of the team. Each member of the team should know what they are responsible for, and should be willing to do it. We will likely have a planning session where we are able to decide these roles.

3. Create user personas for our application. This will allow us to tailor our application's user interface and overall look and feel to our user base. This will allow us to get started on the high-level interface sketches and basic prototyping. We will likely be using a tool such as Xtensio for this.

4. Create a workflow to organize the team with. This includes GitHub etiquette, which should be clearly defined before we commit any real work to GitHub.

5. Research algorithms, tools and datasets for the core of our data analysis. If there are any libraries that simplify our task, we should find them right away to minimize our development costs. We should look into whether analyzing the crypto-currency market has been attempted by any other open source projects or public blogs or articles as well. Seeing as this will get the data analysis component of our application started, this should be a priority. We will likely use search engines to gather info and compile it into a central document. 

6. Decide on a tech stack to use. We should consider the pros and cons of various languages and frameworks while also weighing in on which team members are proficient in each of these languages and frameworks, respectively. Deciding on a tech stack as soon as possible will allow us to start development sooner. We will look at similar projects and see what technologies were used in those projects, and we will have a review meeting where we will survey each group member as to his proficiencies.

#### Artifacts

 * Rough sketch - a high level overview of the flow for our product. This sketch should only describe "what" the application does. This sketch will allow us to determine the core features we need to implement.
 
 * Xtensio - an easy to use platform to create, collaborate, share and present user personas. We will use this to clearly represent sample user personas in order to understand our user base.
