## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

> When: Thursday, March 9, 2017, 6:30pm
 
> Where: In-person, Slack, GitHub

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

At one of our in-person meetings, we were able to quickly reach a consensus on delegating our coding tasks for this deliverable. Everyone agreed on the task allocations and they also turned out to align with their coding interests. Akshay was responsible for setting up our repository and code on-boarding instructions. Akshay and Aaron were in charge of back-end code, while Ian, Harold, and Saakshaat were in charge of front-end. We agreed on collaborating on writing the script.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

At one of our in-person meetings, we collectively agreed on our next in-person meeting time & date. However, due to team members’ academic workload and personal commitments, we had to cancel our meeting on the day-of. This pushed back our timeline since we had to postpone our group discussions and planning to the next meeting. Next time, an effective way to mitigate last-minute meeting reschedulings is to send a reminder / confirmation message on Slack informing everyone of the upcoming meeting time and place.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Because a lot of ideas and thought processes were exchanged during our in-person planning meetings, we tended to get quite involved in the verbal discussions, often times forgetting to write down the ideas that were mentioned and analyzed. Due to this, during the meetings we sometimes had to spend time backtracking our thought processes, on for example, why we decided to use Django over NodeJS. Next time, we should have a dedicated team member taking meeting minutes so that valuable meeting insights are not lost or forgotten, but rather documented for our own reference as well as an artifact.

We found ourselves most productive when physically working together in-person: we get the most tasks done while ensuring that we’re on the same page. We also bounce ideas off one another and make sure we’re not missing anything in our code or deliverables. Next time, we should consider getting together on a weekend earlier during the day (when we’re still awake and not tired down by lectures) to work together on code and other deliverables. Another advantage of working on weekends is that we are less bound by time constraints, e.g. we don’t have to worry about commuting home too late.
