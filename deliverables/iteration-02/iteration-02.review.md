## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

At one of our in-person meetings, we were able to quickly reach a consensus on delegating our coding tasks for this deliverable. Everyone agreed on the task allocations and they also turned out to align with their coding interests. Akshay was responsible for setting up our repository and code on-boarding instructions. Akshay and Aaron were in charge of back-end code, while Ian, Harold, and Saakshaat were in charge of front-end. We agreed on collaborating on writing the script.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

At one of our in-person meetings, we collectively agreed on our next in-person meeting time & date. However, due to team membersâ€™ academic workload and personal commitments, we had to cancel our meeting on the day-of. This pushed back our timeline since we had to postpone our group discussions and planning to the next meeting. Next time, an effective way to mitigate last-minute meeting reschedulings is to send a reminder / confirmation message on Slack informing everyone of the upcoming meeting time and place.
