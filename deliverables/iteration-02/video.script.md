INTRO: (BASIC PRODUCT OVERVIEW/TARGET USERS + VIDEO INTRO) - 45 seconds

Welcome to CryptoWealth, an automated crypto-currency advisory and investing web application.

Our online platform aims to facilitate user investment in crypto-currencies. By acquiring personal user data in a fluid and user-friendly manner, then matching it with actively-traded crypto-currencies via our proprietary algorithm that monitors and analyzes historical trends, we propose recommended portfolios to users so that they can easily make informed personal investment decisions.

These unique crypto-currency portfolios are constructed for each of our users based on their available capital, risk tolerance, personal interests and preferences, and various other parameters.

Think of our application as a fusion of the “traditional” debt and equity securities robo-advisors, such as WealthSimple and Betterment, with less mainstream investment vehicles, i.e. crypto-currencies like BitCoin, Ethereum and LiteCoin.

Our application is targeted towards a wide variety of individuals, from those who are wary of established government-regulated centralized currency systems, to those who see potential or are simply interested in the crypto-currency market but either lack knowledge or time to start investing.

In our video we will demonstrate a couple of example user walk throughs, displaying how our application could be utilized by a variety of people. 


DEMO:  - 100 seconds

User A - Conservative Portfolio
  The first user portfolio we will see is for a conservative investor.  Acting as if we are a new user navigating to the    website for the first time, we will input our user preferences through the questionnaire and generate a portfolio.
  (SELECT START QUESTIONNAIRE)
  
  Our conservative investor is looking to invest for a relatively short term, lets say 1 - 3 years
  (SELECT 1 - 3 YEARS, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  They have a daughter going to college in a few years so they are looking to save for the childrens education 
  (SELECT CHILDRENS EDUCATION, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  They currently have some debt
  (SELECT YES, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  They do not have an emergency fund
  (SELECT NO, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  And they make less than 60k a year
  (SELECT LESS THAN 60K, NEXT QUESTION)

  Upon submitting this user information we see that a customized portfolio has been generated for this user.  Those with knowledge of cryptocurrencies will acknowledge that the portfolio is constructed of more well established, safer crypto-currencies for our conservative investor.

User B - Aggressive Portfolio
  This next portfolio is will represent an investor who would like to take on more risk
    (SELECT CRYPTOWEALTH DEMO - TOP LEFT CORNER)
  
  Our risky investor is looking to invest for a long term, say 5 - 10 years
  (SELECT 5 - 10 YEARS, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  They are saving up for a house
  (SELECT BUYING A HOUSE, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  They do not currently have debt
  (SELECT NO, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  They do have an emergency fund
  (SELECT YES, NEXT QUESTION)
  
  And they make more than 200k a year
  (SELECT MORE THAN 200K, NEXT QUESTION)

  Here we see a portfolio generated for our risky investor that is different than that of our conservative investor.  These crypto-currencies are less established and more volatile.


DISCUSSION: -  30 second
Here we have seen how unique portfolios will be constructed for individuals with differing preferences, social perceptions, and financial backgrounds. As we have shown, getting started is as simple as answering a few simple questions. We do all the computation and analysis, and provide you a mathematically-backed portfolio for you to begin investing.

In our next steps we will be mainly focusing our efforts on enhancing the user-interface, generating a more reliable algorithm to construct crypto-currency portfolios.
