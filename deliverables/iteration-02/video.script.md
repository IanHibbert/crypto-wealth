CSC301 Iteration #2 Script


INTRO: (BASIC PRODUCT OVERVIEW/TARGET USERS + VIDEO INTRO) - 45 seconds

Welcome to CryptoWealth, an automated crypto-currency advisory and investing web application.

Our online platform aims to facilitate user investment in crypto-currencies. By acquiring personal user data in a fluid and user-friendly manner, then matching it with actively-traded crypto-currencies via our proprietary algorithm that monitors and analyzes historical trends, we propose recommended portfolios to users so that they can easily make informed personal investment decisions.

These unique crypto-currency portfolios are constructed for each of our users based on their available capital, risk tolerance, personal interests and preferences, and various other parameters.

Think of our application as a fusion of the “traditional” debt and equity securities robo-advisors, such as WealthSimple and Betterment, with less mainstream investment vehicles, i.e. crypto-currencies like BitCoin, Ethereum and LiteCoin.

Our application is targeted towards a wide variety of individuals, from those who are wary of established government-regulated centralized currency systems, to those who see potential or are simply interested in the crypto-currency market but either lack knowledge or time to start investing.
