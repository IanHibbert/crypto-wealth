#### Events

As our adherence to in-person meetings last iteration worked well for us, we will stick to a similar schedule this time around.

The first meeting is our in-person planning meeting at UofT, on March 13, 2017 at 8:00 pm. Here, we will decide on the scope of this iteration, as we will decide on our issues to be finished, and our future meeting plans. This is be our iteration planning meeting.

The second meeting will be on March 20, 2017 at 8:00 pm. This is our weekly sync meeting as we will discuss any updates we had from the previous week and what our next steps will be.

The third meeting will be on March 22, 2017 and it will be an in-person meeting at UofT. This will be a coding session as we will extensively work on our issues with the entire team present in order to get group approval on things (e.g. design choices, REST API endpoints).

The final meeting will be on March 23, 2017 and it will be an in-person meeting at UofT. This will be our review meeting as we meet to finalize the video and finish our iteration goals. We will also use this time to do a sync meeting as we perform code review.

#### Artifacts

We plan to create documents which will be pushed to the GitHub repository, including deliverables.

There are not many artifacts for Process this time, as we reach the stage where many of the group members are comfortable with the process we had set in our last iteration.

 * A task board on ZenHub
 * GitHub pull requests, issues and Burndown graphs detailing each group member's work over time.

We will be assigning tasks based off of our workflow document and off of the technologies each group member is most comfortable with. We will assign all tasks from the start of the iteration as we will not likely have many fatal issues that come up later in development as we keep our iteration relatively small. All tasks will be kept track of on ZenHub and will be put on a flow similar to Kanban; we will treat the entire iteration as a sprint and will keep track of issues as they move from "To do" to "In progress" to "Review/QA". Lastly, tasks will not be prioritized in any particular order. We will allow group members to take whatever tasks they feel are relevant.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

1. We should finally isolate a potential working algorithm for portfolio generation. This is the core of our application and a rough working version should at least be finished.

2. _As a user, I should be able to complete a questionnaire to see how risk tolerant I am, and then receive a risk profile and portfolio which I can sign up with._ The beginning application flow of this project should be completed. This includes the finalized questionnaire, being able to input how much money to allocate towards a portfolio, and seeing a visualization of this profile.

3. _As a user, I should be able to register with a portfolio, and later login to that same portfolio._ Login/register controls should be working. We must also save users and portfolios to our database to retrieve them later.

4. _As a user, I should be able to see changes in my portfolio over time in an easy to understand manner._ Portfolios should update every day, and the change should be visible in numerical and chart-based formats.

5. _As a user, I should see an interface which is intuitive and visually pleasing._ We will improve our front-end user experience greatly from our previous iteration.

6. _As a user, I should be able to see every change in my portfolio allocation history._ We will have an activity log of automatic updates to portfolios.

#### Artifacts

* A script of our video. We will introduce our idea and present it in a short, digestible manner.

* Intermediate screen-shots of our application as we move from design to design.

* Possible colour schemes, logos, concepts.
