# CryptoWealth

## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

> When: Thursday, March 24, 2017, 6:30pm
 
> Where: In-person, Slack, GitHub

## Process - Reflection

Two of our team meetings this iteration were notable due to the communication, collaboration, and productivity that occurred. Everyone knew what they were supposed to work on and had an aligned vision for our project. While we were individually coding our parts at the same table, we would occasionally bounce ideas off of one-another, ask questions, peer-debug, discuss which plugins to use (and how to use them), and analyze implementations of our code features in ReactJS. These 2 team meetings were each 4-7 hours in duration, and highlighted our team’s strength in comfortably working together in a fast=paced collaborative process. Part of this success is due to a mutually agreed-upon end goal of how we envisioned CryptoWealth. Another part is attributed to the fact that many unexpected issues popped up as we were developing, so our physical proximity and willingness to assist one another proved to be synergetic in moving towards our common goal.

#### Decisions that turned out well

Using Wealthsimple as are primary benchmarking application. We analyzed their web application and user flow and learned from what they did well. After all, our application is addressing a gap in their user and asset base, prospective cryptocurrency investors and cryptocurrencies as an investment vehicle.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Chart.js raised a lot of compatibility and other issues. V1 had deprecated code and non0supported features and V2 had awkward dependencies that were really time-consuming to solve. After a long time debugging, we were finally able to successfully integrate Chart.js V2 into our code.

2. Python-related browser certification issues significantly delayed development for certain team members. It was not an issue common to everyone, which made it hard to replicate and find the source of the issue. After much trial and error, as well as online research, a workaround was devised in our configuration file.

#### Planned changes



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. Learning and implementing data visualization plugins to professionally, dynamically, and interestingly represent cryptocurrency investment data.

2. Styling our site to make it more aesthetically appealing and presentable.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. Implementing a log or history of users’ prior portfolio allocations. These may change daily based on cryptocurrency market volatility, and we intended to track these portfolio changes and display them to the user for reference.

#### Tasks that weren't planned but were completed:



## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. We find that we are most productive when working together. We can more easily discuss and share ideas with one another. And due to our facility in collaborating, this results in a goal-oriented positive work environment where we are motivated and seek to accomplish tasks at a high quality. 2)
