### INTRO: (BASIC PRODUCT OVERVIEW/TARGET USERS + VIDEO INTRO) - 45 seconds

(SCREEN = Home Page)
Welcome to CryptoWealth, an automated crypto-currency advisory and investing web application.

Our online platform aims to facilitate user investment in crypto-currencies. By tracking currency trends and using predictive analytics, our website platform will enable users to make intelligent decisions while navigating the crypto-currency market.

Unique crypto-currency portfolios will be constructed for each investor based on the level of risk they are willing to accept, their personal interests, preferences and a variety of other parameters. 

Think of our application as a fusion between the traditional debt and equity securities robo-advisors, such as WealthSimple and Betterment, but we are addressing a gap in their user base by extending their investment options with crypto-currencies like BitCoin, Ethereum and LiteCoin.

In our video we will demonstrate a single user walk-through, displaying how a user would use our application.

### DEMO:  - 100 seconds

First we will act as a potential investor by filling out a simple questionnaire (SELECT = 'Start Questionnaireâ€™)

Our investor is looking to invest for a long term, say 5 - 10 years (SELECT 5 - 10 YEARS, NEXT QUESTION)

They are looking to save for retirement (SELECT BUYING A HOUSE, NEXT QUESTION)

They do not currently have debt (SELECT NO, NEXT QUESTION)

They do have an emergency fund (SELECT YES, NEXT QUESTION)

They make more than 200k a year (SELECT MORE THAN 200K, NEXT QUESTION)

And they have $100,000 to invest (INPUT 100,000, FINISH QUESTIONNAIRE)

Here we see a sample portfolio has been generated based on our preferences and below we are presented with the option to signup, after inputting some basic information we will create an account (SELECT SIGNUP)

Now we can log in using our the account we just created (SELECT LOGIN)

Here we are redirected to our user's home page, where we can see a dynamic doughnut chart displaying their portfolio allocation, their portfolio value, total earnings and total returns percentage


### DISCUSSION: -  30 seconds
So, we have seen how a prospective user may use our application.  After filling out a simple survey a customized portfolio was generated for our user.  
In our next steps we will be focusing our efforts on enhancing the user-interface and completing some of the extra features that we weren't able to complete this iteration.  This includes adding more informative charts in the 'Analytics' tab, and adding a complete history of a users automatic portfolio adjustments under the 'Activity Log' tab.
