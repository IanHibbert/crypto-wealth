### What are you planning to build?

"Automated advisory and investing service for trading crypto-currencies.‚Äù 

  By tracking currency trends and using predictive analytics, our website platform will enable users to make intelligent decisions while navigating this new and exciting market.  Unique crypto-currency portfolios will be constructed for each investor based on the level of risk they are willing to accept, their personal interests/preferences and a variety of other parameters.  Each portfolio will contain a set of crypto-currencies of differing weights.  A users portfolio (or portfolios) will be continuously reevaluated and adjusted in order to react to market fluctuations.  Our data analytics backend will be driven by algorithms that condense information from a variety of public sources around the web and output actionable buy/sell events.  Our portfolio generating system will analyze historical exchange data (https://bter.com/ ,https://coinmarketcap.com/ ,https://tradeblock.com/), obtain data from the  crypto-currency community by parsing important articles on blogs and twitter, as well as considering input from a variety of other sources.
   
   
   Total coin supply, technical details, future development plans, mission statement, and community speculation are just a sample of the factors that we will investigate in order to build our investing system.

### Who are your target users?

- Individuals that believe in decentralized currency systems but are overwhelemed by the complexities of the current market
(basically goal simplify the process of entering the market)


### Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

  The crypto-currency trading market is rapdily growing and evolving which presents a large number of arbitrage opportunities, our application looks to exploit these market inefficiencies.  The crypto-currency industry is still within its infancy and only a small set of investors are turning a profit trading crypto-currencies. There are currently a number of crypto-currency platforms available for traders to execute their algorithmic trading strategies. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of the crypto market, making it very difficult for new commers to become profitable.  Our team is striving to open the market up to a larger set of investors who want to enter the market but are overwhelemed by the complexities of the current market environment.  Additionally, we are the only robotic-investment platform that is currently engaged in crypto-currency trading (all other 'robo-advisors' only deal with well established equitites, typically ETFs).
  Currently, traders are continuously scouring the internet in search of blog reviews and possibly cross-referencing that data with historical trends in attempt to find arbitrage opportunities.  Users that are currently playing the market (and having success doing so) are unlikely to switch over completely to our platform.  Instead, as stated previously; we are looking to open the market up to new traders who are not currently using any software to fulfill their needs.
