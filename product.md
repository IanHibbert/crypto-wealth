### What are you planning to build?

"Automated advisory and investing service for trading crypto-currencies.” 

  By tracking currency trends and using predictive analytics, our website platform will enable users to make intelligent decisions while navigating this new and exciting market.  Unique crypto-currency portfolios will be constructed for each investor based on the level of risk they are willing to accept, their personal interests/preferences and a variety of other parameters.  Each portfolio will contain a set of crypto-currencies of differing weights.  A users portfolio (or portfolios) will be continuously reevaluated and adjusted in order to react to market fluctuations.  Our data analytics backend will be driven by algorithms that condense information from a variety of public sources around the web and output actionable buy/sell events.  Our portfolio generating system will analyze historical trading data (https://bter.com/ ,https://coinmarketcap.com/ ,https://tradeblock.com/), obtain data from the crypto-currency community by parsing articles on blogs and twitter, and consider input from a variety of other sources.  Our platform can be thought of as a combination between tradional robo-advisors (WealthSimple, Betterment, etc..) and crypto-currencies (BitCoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin, etc..).  Our aim is to provide a clear path to new investors wishing to enter the crypto-currency market place.
   
   
 EXTRA (Total coin supply, technical details, future development plans, mission statement, and community speculation are just a sample of the factors that we will investigate in order to build our investing system.)

### Who are your target users?

Our target users can range from vulnerable security-conscious individuals lacking trust in mainstream centralized establishments to simply those who are interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, a more novel investment vehicle.

Specifically, our users can include those who:
- are politically, socially, and economically vulnerable, such as activists, journalists, protesters, and rebels;
- are digital security-conscious;
- believe in or require anonymity;
- lack trust in centralized systems and institutions, such as the government and banks;
- are anti-authoritarian/establishment;
- are financially unreliable or “risky” investors, according to traditional metrics (e.g. credit history, income)
- engage in questionable of illicit activities;
- are tech savvy and looking to invest;
- are looking to diversify their investment portfolio(s);
- are simply interested in cryptocurrencies, or not interested in mainstream equity and debt securities.


### Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

  The crypto-currency trading market is rapdily growing and evolving which presents a large number of arbitrage opportunities, our application looks to exploit these market inefficiencies.  The crypto-currency industry is still within its infancy and only a small set of investors are turning a profit trading crypto-currencies. There are currently a number of crypto-currency platforms available for traders to execute their algorithmic trading strategies. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of the crypto market, making it very difficult for new commers to become profitable.  Our team is striving to open the market up to a larger set of investors who want to enter the market but are overwhelemed by the complexities of the current market environment.  Additionally, we are the only robotic-investment platform that is currently engaged in crypto-currency trading (all other 'robo-advisors' only deal with well established equitites, typically ETFs).
  
  Currently, traders are continuously scouring the internet in search of blog reviews and possibly cross-referencing that data with historical trends in an attempt to find arbitrage opportunities.  Users that are currently playing the market (and having success doing so) are unlikely to switch over completely to our platform.  Instead, as stated previously; we are looking to open the market up to new traders who are not currently using any software to fulfill their needs.
