### What are you planning to build?

"Automated advisory and investing service for trading crypto-currencies.” 

  By tracking currency trends and using predictive analytics, our website platform will enable users to make intelligent decisions while navigating this new and exciting market.  Unique crypto-currency portfolios will be constructed for each investor based on the level of risk they are willing to accept, their personal interests/preferences and a variety of other parameters.  Each portfolio will contain a set of crypto-currencies of differing weights.  A users portfolio (or portfolios) will be continuously reevaluated and adjusted in order to react to market fluctuations.  Our data analytics backend will be driven by algorithms that condense information from a variety of public sources around the web and output actionable buy/sell events.  Our portfolio generating system will analyze historical trading data (https://bter.com/ ,https://coinmarketcap.com/ ,https://tradeblock.com/), obtain data from the crypto-currency community by parsing articles on blogs and twitter, and consider input from a variety of other sources.  Our platform can be thought of as a combination between tradional robo-advisors (WealthSimple, Betterment, etc..) and crypto-currencies (BitCoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin, etc..).  Our aim is to provide a clear path to new investors wishing to enter the crypto-currency market place.
   
   
 EXTRA (Total coin supply, technical details, future development plans, mission statement, and community speculation are just a sample of the factors that we will investigate in order to build our investing system.)

### Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

  The crypto-currency trading market is rapdily growing and evolving which presents a large number of arbitrage opportunities, our application looks to exploit these market inefficiencies.  The crypto-currency industry is still within its infancy and only a small set of investors are turning a profit trading crypto-currencies. There are currently a number of crypto-currency platforms available for traders to execute their algorithmic trading strategies. However, this requires in-depth knowledge of the crypto market, making it very difficult for new commers to become profitable.  Our team is striving to open the market up to a larger set of investors who want to enter the market but are overwhelemed by the complexities of the current market environment.  With todays markets becoming increasingly interdependent, many investors are wary that events out of their control (Brexit, Greece default, etc..) can have severe negative impacts on their investments.  That is part of the reason why decentralized currencies seem more attractive than traditional markets.  Crypto-currencies do not experience market fluctuations caused by government actions in the same way that established exchanges do.  An investor concerned about these potential risks would likely see our applciation as suitable alternative.
  
  Currently, traders are continuously scouring the internet in search of blog reviews and possibly cross-referencing that data with historical trends in an attempt to find arbitrage opportunities.  Users that are currently playing the market (and having success doing so) are unlikely to switch over completely to our platform.  Instead, as stated previously; we are looking to open the market up to new traders who are not currently using any software to fulfill their needs.
  
  
  
### Highlights

- Most members couldn’t attend an in-person team meeting on Feb. 5, since many of us commute. This was, however, a last-minute change in plan as we initially planned to have everyone in attendance. A preferable meeting medium is online via Discord, Google Docs, and Slack, where everyone can attend from wherever they are. And next time, this can be planned in advance through an online collaborate calendar that serves as a scheduler and reminder system.
- We talk a lot when we meet, so we found that it is most efficient to agree upon task delegation, internal deadlines, and meeting dates in-person instead of working on deliverables. Deliverables writing/coding can be done individually in our own time so that our individual thought processes and concentration are not distracted by group communication. Group meetings are good for already-committed work review and collaborative writing of documents that reflect upon our team process, e.g. iteration review.
- Approaching our product from the perspective of a user was really helpful and enlightening, such that it forces a change in perspective and encourages questions that you otherwise might not have asked. Questions such as:
  How do I make this simpler than existing products/services for the user?
  Why would a user use this?
  How do we differentiate ourselves (in terms of features, UI) from similar products for traditional equity and debt securities investing?
